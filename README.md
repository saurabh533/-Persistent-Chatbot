langgraph.py implements a stateful chatbot built with LangGraph
The agent supports:

Long-term memory to recall past sessions per user

Branching workflows with tool nodes (Search, Database, etc.)

Resumable conversations across sessions

Streaming deployment on Streamlit for interactive use

This project demonstrates how LangGraph can be used to design deterministic, observable, and memory-augmented conversational agents.
